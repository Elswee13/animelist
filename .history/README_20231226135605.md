# Building an Anime Vault using Next JS 14 Server Side App

This app was maded with:

1.Server Actions
2.Infinite Scroll
3.Framer Motion Animations

This is a small practice to keep knowing more about server actions in next js 14. Creating this small app was with the point of keep practicing, since programming is a big world of differents lenguajes and the lenguajes evolves, i always needed to practice more.
